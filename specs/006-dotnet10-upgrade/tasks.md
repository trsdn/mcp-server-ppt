# Tasks: .NET 10 Framework Upgrade

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/006-dotnet10-upgrade/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, spec.md ✅, research.md ✅

**Tests**: Not required for this feature (configuration-only upgrade, validated by existing integration tests)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story from spec.md to enable independent verification.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Exact file paths included in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup

**Purpose**: Ensure prerequisites are met before making changes

- [x] T001 Verify .NET 10 SDK is installed locally by running `dotnet --list-sdks`

---

## Phase 2: User Story 1 - Developer Builds Project with .NET 10 SDK (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: All projects compile and tests pass with .NET 10 SDK

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - verify prerequisites first
- **User Story 1 (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - CORE UPGRADE (MVP)
- **User Story 2 (Phase 3)**: Depends on User Story 1 (workflows need correct target framework)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 4)**: Can start after User Story 1 (documentation can parallel User Story 2)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 5)**: Can start after User Story 1 (documentation can parallel others)
- **Verification (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories complete

### Within Each User Story

- T003 (global.json) must complete before T004-T011 (csproj files)
- T004-T011 (csproj files) can all run in parallel
- T012-T014 (verification) must follow T003-T011
- Documentation tasks (T023-T031) can all run in parallel

### Parallel Opportunities

```text
# After T003 (global.json), all csproj updates can run together:
T004, T005, T006, T007, T008, T009, T010, T011

# All workflow updates can run in parallel:
T015, T016, T017, T018, T019, T020, T021

# All documentation updates can run in parallel:
T023, T024, T025, T026, T027, T028, T029, T030, T031
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Setup (T001-T002)
2. Complete User Story 1 (T003-T014)
3. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Build + tests pass locally
4. Can deploy/demo .NET 10 builds immediately

### Full Delivery

1. User Story 1: Core framework upgrade (blocking)
2. User Story 2: CI/CD updates (parallel with US3/US4 documentation)
3. User Story 3 + 4: Documentation updates (can run in parallel)
4. Verification: Final checks and PR

### Total Task Count

| Phase | Tasks | Parallelizable |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Setup | 2 | 0 |
| User Story 1 (P1) | 12 | 8 |
| User Story 2 (P2) | 7 | 7 |
| User Story 3 (P3) | 7 | 6 |
| User Story 4 (P3) | 3 | 0 |
| Verification | 7 | 0 |
| **Total** | **38** | **21** |

## Notes

- All [P] tasks can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- No new tests required - existing integration tests validate the upgrade
- Rollback plan documented in plan.md if critical issues discovered
- Constitution already updated to v1.1.0 with .NET 10 SDK requirement
