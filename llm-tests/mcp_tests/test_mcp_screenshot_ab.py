"""A/B test: Does the screenshot tool improve dashboard layout quality?

This test compares two agent variants building the same complex dashboard:
- Control (without-screenshot): Cannot use the screenshot tool
- Experiment (with-screenshot): Can visually verify and self-correct via screenshot

Both agents receive the same natural-language prompt to create a dashboard with
4 charts and 2 data tables with strict no-overlap requirements.

How to interpret results (in TestResults/report.html):
- Compare pass rates: does the screenshot variant succeed more often?
- Compare token usage: how much overhead does visual verification add?
- Check if experiment variant calls screenshot and self-corrects overlaps
- The AI summary model analyzes variant effectiveness automatically
- Image assertions verify the visual output quality (experiment only)

Create a new Excel file at {path}.

Set up two data tables:

Table 1 - "SalesData" starting at A1 with 7 rows (header + 6 data rows):
Region, Q1, Q2, Q3
North, 45000, 52000, 48000
South, 38000, 41000, 44000
East, 51000, 49000, 53000
West, 42000, 47000, 50000
Central, 35000, 39000, 42000
Midwest, 40000, 43000, 46000

Table 2 - "ExpenseData" starting at F1 with 5 rows (header + 4 data rows):
Department, Budget, Actual, Variance
Marketing, 120000, 115000, 5000
Engineering, 250000, 262000, -12000
Sales, 180000, 175000, 5000
Operations, 95000, 102000, -7000

Now create a professional dashboard with these 4 charts. Position them so that
NO chart overlaps any other chart or any data table:

1. A clustered column chart from SalesData showing all regions and quarters.
   Place it below the data tables.
2. A pie chart showing Q3 sales distribution by region.
   Place it to the right of the column chart.
3. A line chart showing the sales trend across Q1-Q3 for North and South regions.
   Place it below the column chart.
4. A bar chart from ExpenseData showing Budget vs Actual by department.
   Place it to the right of the line chart.

Requirements:
- No chart may overlap any other chart or any data table
- Each chart must have a descriptive title
- The dashboard should look professional and well-organized

After placing all charts, take a screenshot to verify the final layout is correct
with no overlaps. Save the file.
